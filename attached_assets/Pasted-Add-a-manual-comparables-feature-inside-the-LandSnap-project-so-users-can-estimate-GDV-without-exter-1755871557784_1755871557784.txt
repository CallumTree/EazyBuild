Add a manual comparables feature inside the LandSnap project so users can estimate GDV without external APIs. Inside the Finance tab create a new Comps panel. Allow user to enter a postcode for context. Allow adding comparable sales rows with fields id address postcode beds propertyType date priceGBP giaSqft notes. Compute price per sqft as priceGBP divided by giaSqft and round to nearest pound. Show a simple table where comps can be added edited deleted. Add settings for months to include default 18 minimum beds optional maximum beds optional and an outlier rejection factor default 1.5. Filter comps so only those within the set months and bed ranges are used. Add a toggle strict mode that if enabled requires the outward postcode to match. For outlier rejection compute first and third quartiles and interquartile range then drop any comps outside the normal bounds. If fewer than three comps remain fall back to the pre rejection set. From the final set compute median and quartiles. Recommend the median as the suggested price per sqft but allow manual override. Provide a button Apply to Finance that updates the finance price per sqft and triggers recomputation of GDV and residual. Save comps postcode and settings with the project so import and export JSON includes them. In the PDF export add a Market Evidence section if comps exist with postcode context count of comps used months filter and quartile stats plus up to five lines showing address beds property type month year and price per sqft. Validate that each comp has address date price and giaSqft. Disable Apply to Finance if no valid comps exist. Editing any field should recompute price per sqft immediately. Add a helper button to insert a preset row with today date three beds semi type gia 900 sqft price 250000. Implement helper functions for calculating price per sqft for quantiles for filtering with strict mode for outlier rejection and for computing final stats. Handle month differences using year times twelve plus month. Display currency with commas and no decimals. Display dates in table as yyyy dash mm while storing full ISO.
