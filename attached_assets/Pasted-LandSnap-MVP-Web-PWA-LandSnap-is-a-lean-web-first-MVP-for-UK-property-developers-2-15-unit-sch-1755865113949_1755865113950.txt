LandSnap – MVP (Web PWA)

LandSnap is a lean web-first MVP for UK property developers (2–15 unit schemes).
It helps you go from standing on a plot to a quick feasibility + offer pack in minutes.

Features

Obstacle Tagging – mark ponds, trees, structures
Basic Layout – choose house type, estimate unit count, preview markers
Finance Calc – GDV, build costs, fees, contingency, profit, residual land value
Offer Pack PDF – one-click export (site map + financials)
Local Save – projects auto-save to browser (localStorage)
PWA – install on Android/iOS via “Add to Home Screen”

Tech Stack
React + Vite + TypeScript
Leaflet + Turf.js (mapping & geo calcs)
Zustand (state) + Zod (validation)
Tailwind CSS (UI)
pdfmake + html2canvas (PDF export)

Notes
GPS = feasibility only (not survey-grade)
Keep screen awake during walk (no background tracking in browser)
Map tiles need data (no full offline maps yet)
Market comps = user input (Rightmove/Zoopla integration is Phase 2)
