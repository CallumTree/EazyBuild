Build a manual comparables feature inside the existing LandSnap web app so users can estimate GDV without external APIs. Add a Comps subpanel inside the Finance tab that lets users set a project postcode, add comparable sales rows, and see a recommended price per sqft. Each comp has id, address, postcode, beds, type (detached, semi, terraced, flat, bungalow, other), ISO date, priceGBP, giaSqft, optional notes, and a derived pricePerSqft = priceGBP divided by giaSqft rounded to nearest pound. Show a simple table to add, edit, and delete comps plus settings for includeMonths default 18, optional minBeds, optional maxBeds, and iqrK default 1.5. Filter comps to those within includeMonths from today and within bed limits; add a postcode strict mode toggle that if on requires same outward postcode e.g. SA41. Reject outliers using IQR where values outside Q1 minus iqrK times IQR or above Q3 plus iqrK times IQR are dropped; if fewer than 3 remain then fall back to pre-rejection set. Compute p25 median and p75 and display count used and these stats; set recommended price per sqft to the median but allow manual override and add a button Apply to Finance that writes this number into finance.pricePerSqft and triggers a recompute of GDV and residual. Persist comps, postcode, and settings on the project via the existing store and include them in import and export JSON. In the PDF export add a Market Evidence section when comps exist showing postcode context, comps used count within months, and the three stats plus up to five lines of address beds type month and year and price per sqft. Validate required fields address date price and giaSqft and disable Apply to Finance if no valid comps; editing any field should recompute price per sqft instantly; include a quick Add Preset row with default today 3 beds semi 900 sqft and 250000 price. Implement small utilities for price per sqft calculation, quantiles, filtering with strict mode, outlier rejection, and overall stats; handle month math with year times twelve plus month; format currency with thousands separators and no decimals and display dates as yyyy-mm in the table while storing ISO.
