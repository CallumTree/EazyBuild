# LandSnap – MVP (Web PWA)

LandSnap is a **lean web-first MVP** for UK property developers (2–15 unit schemes).  
It helps you go from **standing on a plot** to a **quick feasibility + offer pack** in minutes.

## 🚀 Features
- **GPS Walk** – walk the site perimeter on your phone, auto-draw boundary
- **Obstacle Tagging** – mark ponds, trees, structures
- **Basic Layout** – choose house type, estimate unit count, preview markers
- **Finance Calc** – GDV, build costs, fees, contingency, profit, residual land value
- **Offer Pack PDF** – one-click export (site map + financials)
- **Local Save** – projects auto-save to browser (localStorage)
- **PWA** – install on Android/iOS via “Add to Home Screen”

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Leaflet + Turf.js (mapping & geo calcs)
- Zustand (state) + Zod (validation)
- Tailwind CSS (UI)
- pdfmake + html2canvas (PDF export)
- vite-plugin-pwa (offline shell)

## 📦 Quick Start (Replit)
1. Click **Run** → dev server runs at port 5173  
2. Open preview → see map  
3. **Create project** → give it a name  
4. **Survey Tab**:
   - Tap **Start GPS**, walk perimeter, tap **Stop**
   - Add/edit points manually if needed
   - Add **obstacles** (pond/tree/etc.)  
5. **Layout Tab**: choose house type → see estimated units & preview dots  
6. **Finance Tab**: tweak £/sqft, build £/sqft, fees, contingency, profit → see GDV & RLV  
7. **Offer Tab**: preview summary → click **Export PDF**  
8. Projects auto-save (refresh safe)

## 💰 Default Assumptions (editable)
- Price: £300/sqft (~£3,229/m²)
- Build cost: £180/sqft (~£1,938/m²)
- Fees: 10% of build
- Contingency: 10% of build
- Profit: 20% of GDV
- Roads/open space: 20% of site area
- Obstacle buffer: 3m radius

House type presets:
- 2-bed semi (75 sqm GIA)
- 3-bed semi (90 sqm GIA)
- 3-bed det (105 sqm GIA)
- 4-bed det (130 sqm GIA)

## ⚠️ Notes
- **GPS ≈ feasibility only** (not survey-grade)  
- Keep screen awake during walk (no background tracking in browser)  
- Map tiles need data (no full offline maps yet)  
- Market comps = user input (Rightmove/Zoopla integration is Phase 2)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Draw boundary via GPS or manual points  
- Area in sqm + acres displays correctly  
- Obstacles show as pins  
- Layout shows estimated units  
- Finance tab updates GDV & RLV live  
- Offer Pack PDF exports with map + numbers  
- Project persists on refresh  
- App installable as PWA on mobile
